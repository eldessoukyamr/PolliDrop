Suggested Project Description:
PolliDrop is a flower pollination simulation game built for the MSP432 microcontroller using C and FSM design. Players control a circular "bee" using a joystick to collect falling pollen and pollinate flowers before they disappear. The game includes interactive menus, score tracking, and dynamic visualsâ€”all rendered in real time on embedded hardware.
